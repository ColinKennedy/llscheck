# llscheck

LLSCheck is a command-line utility that leverages the [Lua Language Server](https://luals.github.io)
for linting and static analysis of Lua code.

It delivers user-friendly reports, enhancing readability compared to raw JSON output. Moreover,
LLSCheck seamlessly integrates with popular CI tools, i.e the exit code is a failure when the Lua
Language Server finds issues.
